Plex New Transcoder Unofficial Source Repository README
=======================================================

This is the source pulled from [Plex](http://www.plex.tv/) for the Plex Media Server (closed
source application).  The repository was generated by downloading the original transcoder
(Plex Transcoder), included in the current build with source located at http://files.plexapp.com/elan/ffmpeg/PlexTranscoder.tar.bz2

After downloading, I committed and grabbed the Plex New Transcoder at http://files.plexapp.com/elan/ffmpeg/PlexNewTranscoder.tar.bz2
and overwrote the transcoder to allow a somewhat reasonable diff between the versions. Much of the code is simply FFmpeg and the
original readme is provided below.

There are two directories off (well, one currently, see below) of `plex-ffmpeg-source` which point to the PlexNewTranscoder (this
is the transcoding piece, according to the LICENSE file) and PlexTranscoder (this is the scanning piece).  My hope is that
by refreshing every update, there will be a reasonable graph of changes, albiet only going back as far as the script runs unless
I can grab past versions.

Refresh and Update
------------------

I've configured a cron job on a remote server to execute the refresh-repo.zsh script, daily.  It will make a commit every time it
sees a new version (regardless of whether or not that version has new ffmpeg code), however, it will only update ffmpeg code when
the code is updated

Unfortunately, there are caveats involved in all of this.  Plex doesn't provide a very easy way to automate discovery of the 
location of the ffmpeg sources.  The only method I could find was to grep the LICENSE file in the Plex archive, which is what the
`refresh-repo.zsh` script currently does.  In addition, at least as of the May 2018, one of the links doesn't work (I'll follow
up with them on that), so only one of the archives is present.  If they substantially change the names of the files, the script
might fail to parse/distinguish between the scanner and the transcoder ffmpeg code.

That ... and I wrote the script in about 10 minutes.  The code quality is pretty awful and it's `zsh` (only tested with 5.5.1).
Something else, entirely, could go wrong.
